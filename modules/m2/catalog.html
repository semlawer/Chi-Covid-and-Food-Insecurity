        <p class="courseblockdesc">
            This course teaches the basics of building and maintaining a site on
            the World Wide Web. We discuss Internet terminology and how the
            Internet and its associated technologies work. Topics include
            programming websites, hypertext markup language (HTML), Cascading
            Style Sheets (CSS), and Common Gateway Interface (CGI) scripts
            (using PERL). Students also learn how to use JavaScript to add
            client-side functionality.</p>

        <p class="courseblockdesc">

            This three-quarter sequence teaches computational thinking and
            skills to students who are majoring in the sciences, mathematics,
            and economics. Lectures cover topics in (1) programming, such as
            recursion, abstract data types, and processing data; (2) computer
            science, such as clustering methods, event-driven simulation, and
            theory of computation; and to a lesser extent (3) numerical
            computation, such as approximating functions and their derivatives
            and integrals, solving systems of linear equations, and simple
            Monte Carlo techniques. Applications from a wide variety of fields
            serve both as examples in lectures and as the basis for
            programming assignments. In recent offerings, students have
            written programs to evaluate betting strategies, determine the
            number of machines needed at a polling place, and predict the size
            of extinct marsupials. Students learn Java, Python, R and C++.

        <p class="courseblockdesc">
            The course revolves around core ideas behind the management and
            computation of large volumes of data ("Big Data"). Topics include
            (1) Statistical methods for large data analysis, (2) Parallelism
            and concurrency, including models of parallelism and
            synchronization primitives, and (3) Distributed computing,
            including distributed architectures and the algorithms and
            techniques that enable these architectures to be fault-tolerant,
            reliable, and scalable.Â  Students will continue to use R, and will
            also learn C++ and distributed computing tools and platforms,
            including Amazon AWS and Hadoop. This course includes a project
            where students will have to formulate hypotheses about a large
            dataset, develop statistical models to test those hypothesis,
            implement a prototype that performs an initial exploration of the
            data, and a final system to process the entire
            dataset.<br />
